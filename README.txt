\b How to Play\

\b0\fs24 To play the game, you can move around with standard WASD controls. Your goal is to destroy the castle while enemies are shooting cannonballs at you. To do this, you can shoot your projectile rag-dolls by aiming with right click and holding down left click for power while aiming. The more you hold down, the more power your rag-dolls will have. Certain structures need more power to destroy. As you destroy the building, you will gain points. To win, you must get 25 points with ammo leftover. You begin the game with 10 projectiles and lose ammo if you are hit or once you fire. Losing the game means that you have ran out of ammo.\

\b\fs28 Technology Requirements\

\b0\fs24 When you first start the game, you are greeted with a main menu with options to play or start. Once you start the game, there are additional UI elements for score, ammo, and a pause menu. Finally, we currently have a win and lose screen implemented. These will likely change, as we eventually want to create an Angry Birds style scoring system with thresholds for stars. As you run around, you can see the forrest-like terrain with a castle directly in front of the starting area. On top of the castle is an enemy AI that will attempt to hit you with cannonballs as you move around. Sounds play when you destroy blocks that explode based on how much power you hit them with. Please note, 
\b the video doesn\'92t include in-game sound but this is something we have implemented
\b0 . For next steps, we hope to add additional levels, a level select, scoring thresholds, and test it with players among other technological features.
